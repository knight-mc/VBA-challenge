Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 2 Challenge - VBA

This Repository is to store the requested materials for the Module 2 Challenge Submission
I have included my vba code as a separate text file (.bas), as well as screenshots of each worksheet of the provided Multiple_year_stock_data excel file. 

There was some confusion on my end because the visuals referenced in the instructions only showed one column with the conditional formatting applied,
      but the instructions and grading rubric seemed to imply that two columns should have the conditional formatting applied. 
      My submission is based off of the information provided in the written instructions and rubric.
